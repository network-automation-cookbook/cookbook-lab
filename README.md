# Network Automation Cookbook Lab

This repository contains the resources for building and managing an observability stack within a network lab environment, specifically designed for the "Modern Network Observability" book. It includes scripts, configuration files, and documentation to set up and operate various observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana Loki, and others, helping you implement and learn about network observability practices in a practical, hands-on manner.

## The repository includes all the lab scenarios from the book, which progressively cover topics from metrics and logs collection all the way to leveraging AI for improving observability practices.

## Requirements

The lab environments are designed to set up a small network and an attached observability stack. Developed and tested on Debian-based systems, we provide **[setup](setup/README.md) documentation to guide** you through automatic setup on a DigitalOcean droplet. This process will provision, install dependencies, and configure the environment automatically. But if you want to host the lab environment, ensure the following:

- `docker` installed (version `26.1.1` or above)
- `containerlab` for the network lab (version `0.54.2` or above)
- `labcli` for managing the network and lab stack (installed with this repository, more details later)
- Arista `cEOS` images for the `containerlab` environment. You can open an account and download them at [arista.com](https://www.arista.com)

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [setup README](./setup/README.md). It provides a comprehensive guide on installing the lab environment on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

### Prepare cEOS image

After downloading the image, use the following command to import them as Docker images:

```bash
# Import cEOS images as Docker images
docker import <path-to-image>/cEOS64-lab-<version>.tar.xz ceos:image
```

## Quickstart

To get started with the network lab and observability stack, you need to:

1. Copy the necessary environment variables to configure the components used within the lab scenarios.

```bash
# Setup environment variables (edit the .env file to your liking)
cp example.env .env
```

2. Install the `labcli` utility command that helps manage the entire lab environment.

```bash
# Install the python dependencies
pip install .
```

3. Test everything is working by deploying a lab that has most of the components configured and ready to go.

```bash
# Start the network lab
labcli lab deploy --scenario batteries-included
```

> NOTE: Our lab comes with a `batteries-included` setup, providing you with everything you need to get started with network observability right away. This setup includes pre-configured tools and detailed step-by-step instructions to help you explore and learn without any hassle. Head over to the [instructions](./chapters/batteries-included/README.md) section to begin!

## Managing Lab Environment with `labcli`

The `labcli` utility tool simplifies managing and monitoring the network lab and observability stack set up within this repository. It provides a suite of commands designed to streamline various tasks associated with your network infrastructure.

### Top-Level Commands

The `labcli` utility includes five main commands to help manage the environment:

- **`labcli setup`**: Manages the overall setup of a remote DigitalOcean droplet hosting this repository and its lab environment. This command simplifies the process of preparing a hosting environment for users.

- **`labcli containerlab`**: Manages the `containerlab` pre-configured setup. All lab scenarios presented in the chapters operate under this network lab configuration.

- **`labcli docker`**: Manages the Docker Compose setups for each lab scenario. It ensures the appropriate containers are running for each specific lab exercise.

- **`labcli lab`**: A wrapper utility that combines `labcli containerlab` and various `labcli docker` commands to perform major actions. For example:

  - `labcli lab purge`: Cleans up all running environments.
  - `labcli lab prepare --scenario ch7`: Purges any scenario that is up and prepares the environment for Chapter 7.

- **`labcli utils`**: Contains utility commands for interacting with the lab environment. This includes scripts for enabling/disabling an interface on a network device to simulate interface flapping and other useful actions.

### Example Usage

For instance, the `labcli lab deploy` command builds and starts a `containerlab` environment along with the observability stack. This command sets up the entire lab scenario, ensuring that all necessary components are up and running.

```bash
# Start the network lab
❯ labcli lab deploy batteries-included --sudo

## Lab Scenarios

The [`chapters/`](./chapters/) folder contains a collection of lab scenarios designed to help you explore modern network observability techniques using open-source tools. These scenarios are directly aligned with the chapters of the book.

Each practical chapter provides two lab scenarios:

1. **Skeleton Scenario (`ch<number>`):** This scenario includes only the bare minimum setup required to follow along with the exercises in the corresponding chapter of the book.
2. **Completed Scenario (`ch<number>-completed`):** This scenario comes fully configured, with all components set up as described in the chapter.

### Overview of Practical Chapters

Here is a brief overview of the practical chapters and the key concepts you will encounter:

- **[`Batteries Included`](./chapters/batteries-included/) Scenario:** This scenario brings everything together in a fully configured environment, offering a glimpse into the full potential of these tools. The batteries-included scenario [README](./chapters/batteries-included/README.md) provides an overview and detailed explanation of the setup, giving you a holistic view of what is achievable with this setup.
