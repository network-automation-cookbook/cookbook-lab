# Network Automation Cookbook Lab

This repository contains the resources for building and managing an network automation stack within a network lab environment, specifically designed for the "Network Automation Cookbook 2n edition" book.

## Requirements

The lab environments are designed to set up a small network and an attached automation stack. Developed and tested on Debian-based systems, we provide **[setup](setup/README.md) documentation to guide** you through automatic setup on a DigitalOcean droplet. This process will provision, install dependencies, and configure the environment automatically. But if you want to host the lab environment, ensure the following:

- `docker` installed (version `26.1.1` or above)
- `containerlab` for the network lab (version `0.54.2` or above)
- `lab` for managing the network and lab stack
- Arista `cEOS` images for the `containerlab` environment. You can open an account and download them at [arista.com](https://www.arista.com)

For detailed setup instructions, please refer to the [setup README](./setup/README.md). It provides a comprehensive guide on installing the lab environment on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

### Prepare cEOS image

After downloading the image, use the following command to import them as Docker images:

```bash
# Import cEOS images as Docker images
docker import <path-to-image>/cEOS64-lab-<version>.tar.xz ceos:image
```

## Quickstart

To get started with the network lab stack, you need to:

1. Copy the necessary environment variables to configure the components used within the lab scenarios.

```bash
# Setup environment variables (edit the .env file to your liking)
cp example.env .env
```

2. Install the `lab` utility command that helps manage the entire lab environment. Example using `uv`:

```bash
# Install the python dependencies
uv pip install .
```

3. Test everything is working by deploying a lab that has most of the components configured and ready to go.

```bash
# Start the network lab
lab lab deploy --scenario batteries-included
```

> NOTE: Our lab comes with a `batteries-included` setup, providing you with everything you need to get started with network lab right away. This setup includes pre-configured tools and detailed step-by-step instructions to help you explore and learn without any hassle. Head over to the [instructions](./chapters/batteries-included/README.md) section to begin!

## Managing Lab Environment with `lab`

The `lab` utility tool simplifies managing and monitoring the network lab and other stack set up within this repository. It provides a suite of commands designed to streamline various tasks associated with your network infrastructure.

### Top-Level Commands

The `lab` utility includes five main commands to help manage the environment:

- **`lab setup`**: Manages the overall setup of a remote DigitalOcean droplet hosting this repository and its lab environment. This command simplifies the process of preparing a hosting environment for users.

- **`lab containerlab`**: Manages the `containerlab` pre-configured setup. All lab scenarios presented in the chapters operate under this network lab configuration.

- **`lab docker`**: Manages the Docker Compose setups for each lab scenario. It ensures the appropriate containers are running for each specific lab exercise.

### Example Usage

For instance, the `lab lab deploy` command builds and starts a `containerlab` environment along with the automation stack. This command sets up the entire lab scenario, ensuring that all necessary components are up and running.

```bash
# Start the network lab
❯ lab lab deploy batteries-included --sudo
